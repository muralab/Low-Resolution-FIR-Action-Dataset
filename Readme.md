# Nagoya University Extremely Low-resolution FIR Image Action Dataset (Version 2018)

Action dataset obtained from a 16*16 far-infrared sensor array mounted on the ceiling.

For more detail of the dataset, please refer to "Dataset_detail.pdf".

This dataset contains the following files:

*  [date(ex. 20170203,20170206,...]	: date
    *  [date]/[raw]/*csv			: action data files obtained a far-infrared sensor array
    *  [date]/[video]/*mp4			: action data files obtained visible-light camera (for reference) (h264 format; not provided yet)
    *  [annotation]/*csv			: annotation files
